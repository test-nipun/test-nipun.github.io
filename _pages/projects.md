**NEW: I am currently not looking for students. The below will be useful once this notice has been removed**



I am looking to work with motivated students! Care about ML/AI/sensors/Python/open source? Want to contribute your bit for a sustainable environment (reducing energy, pollution, etc.)?

I would ideally like you to read through at least one paper from each category below and prepare a summary. This is also or you to understand if your interests match with mine, to guage the fit.

* * *

#### Category A (Data Science)

*   Transferring Decomposed Tensors for Scalable Energy Breakdown across Regions\[[PDF](../papers/batra_aaai_2018.pdf)\]\[[Github](https://github.com/nipunbatra/transferable-energy-breakdown)\]
*   Matrix Factorisation for Scalable Energy Breakdown\[[PDF](../papers/batra_aaai2017.pdf)\]\[[Github](https://github.com/nipunbatra/mf-energybreakdown)\]\[[Poster](../slides/aaai_poster_2017.pdf)\]
*   Gemello: Creating a Detailed Energy Breakdown from just the Monthly Electricity Bill\[[PDF](https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N39733)\]\[[Github](https://github.com/nipunbatra/Gemello)\]\[[Poster](../slides/kdd_poster_final.pdf)\]\[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzgqd9OhvDA)\]

#### Category B (Sensors, Systems and Deployment)

*   If You Measure It, Can You Improve It? Exploring The Value of Energy Disaggregation.\[[PDF](../papers/batra_buildsys_15.pdf)\]\[[Github](https://github.com/nipunbatra/nilm-actionable)\]\[[Slides (.key)](../slides/batra_buildsys_2015_slides final.key)\]\[[Slides (.pdf)](../slides/batra_buildsys_2015_slides final.pdf)\]
*   NILMTK: An Open Source Toolkit for Non-intrusive Load Monitoring\[[PDF](../papers/batra_nilmtk.pdf)\]\[[Slides (.pptx)](../slides/nilmtk_presentation.pptx)\]\[[Slides (.pdf)](../slides/nilmtk_presentation.pdf)\]
*   Itâ€™s Different: Insights into home energy consumption in India\[[PDF](../papers/buildsys_2013.pdf)\]\[[Github](https://github.com/nipunbatra/Home_Deployment)\]\[[Dataset](http://iawe.github.io/)\]\[[Slides (.pptx)](../slides/buildsys_13_slides.pptx)\]\[[Slides (.pdf)](../slides/buildsys_13_slides.pdf)\]

I would also like you to go through the [research method bootcamp material](https://github.com/nipunbatra/CS-Research-Methods-Bootcamp
    ). After having done so, I want you to write an abstract for any new line of research that you would like to do under me.

* * *

**After having gone thorugh the above and having prepared your response, please fill the [following survey form](https://goo.gl/forms/UxFCSJlNZLdqjF0V2) and then write me an email that you have submitted the form**

### Outside students for internships

For students outside IITGN applying for summer internships, please look at SRIP at IIT Gandhinagar. Please also complete the survey form mentioned above.

### Prospective PhD students

In addition to the above survey form, I would request you to formally apply via IIT GN PhD admission portal. Please also see [CSE specific guidelines here](http://cs.iitgn.ac.in/admissions/).

### Prospective Research Assistants

If your goal is to do higher studies abroad or a PhD from India, and you want to strengthen your profile, please write to me after filling the above survey form. I would like to clear upfront that a good publication can often take more than an year of work.

### For IITGN students

After filling the above mentioned survey form, please drop me an email to meet me in person.
